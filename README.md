## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/0xKHA1ED/mcq_to_pdf.git
    cd mcq_to_pdf
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Prepare your data:**
    Ensure you have your question data structured correctly (likely in a Python dictionary or loaded from a file like `data.json`) and that it's passed to the template rendering function in your Flask route. The structure should match what the template expects (`data.chapters`, `chapter.chapterNumber`, `chapter.questions`, etc.).

5.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

6.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
